For the course Computer and Network Security I had to do this project. 

Given a /etc/passwd file, a /etc/shadow file and a limited amount of time, recover as many user passwords as possible using dictionaries of words commonly used in passwords.

The program must:
- be written entirely in C
- contain only code written by yourself
- not use external libraries other than GNU libc (included by default) and libcrypt (-lcrypt)
- not invoke external programs
- compile and run on a standard installation of Ubuntu 11.10 x86-64
